PROJECT-Description:
 I developed a dynamic and user-friendly website for the Karnataka State Police aimed at improving public access to essential services and information. The website features a streamlined complaint registration process that prioritizes ease of use, with a special focus on ensuring that women can lodge complaints swiftly and securely through a dedicated fast complaint section.
The website also includes:
A contact directory of all police stations in Karnataka, allowing users to find the nearest station easily.
A vision statement emphasizing women and child safety, with clear instructions and guidelines on protective measures.
Sections covering key information like visa confirmation processes and government job applications.
An IPC section, where users can familiarize themselves with legal provisions under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
The front-end of the website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring both responsive design and interactivity. My goal was to make the site both informative and accessible, with a focus on enhancing safety and convenience for the public.
